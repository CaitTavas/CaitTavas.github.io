                    <p>Key Words: Fairseq Scripting, Training/Testing Models in Hugging Face</p>
                    <p>Summary: In our class Adv. NLP for Humanities Research Project, my research partner and I addressed the issue of low-resource language's and the lack of data that comes from them. Due to the lack of data, there is a lack of training information and models on them. With limited resources (one t4 GPU) we wanted to create a more accessible low-resource language model that would not need many GPUs and training to compute as the impact of training is environmentally and physically costly. We were able to outperform google translate, and we trained the model so that it performs well on the specific language pair la-es(latin to Spanish) as they are part of the same family tree and my research partner and I both spoke the language.</p>
